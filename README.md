In this project, your group will work together to produce the video game RAIInet, a game similar in style to Stratego. RAIInet is a game played between two opposing players, who take on the role of computer hackers. Each player controls eight pieces, called links. There are two different kinds of links: viruses and data. 

Each player has two goals:

• Download four data.

• Make their opponent download four viruses.

Upon achieving either goal, the player wins the game.
